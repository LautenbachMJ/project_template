# All code should be written in form a Rmarkdown, such as the template file
The template file automatically creates a html file in the lab-book folder that can be appended to entires of an electronic lab-book system (e.g. ELIN).
The template file also creates a new date folder within the result folder to save all output that is saved to the path "result.dir"
